initSidebarItems({"struct":[["MessageStream","A Stream of Kafka messages. It can be used to receive messages as they are consumed from Kafka. Note: there might be buffering between the actual Kafka consumer and the receiving end of this stream, so it is not advised to use automatic commit, as some messages might have been consumed by the internal Kafka consumer but not processed."],["StreamConsumer","A Consumer with an associated polling thread. This consumer doesn't need to be polled and it will return all consumed messages as a `Stream`. Due to the asynchronous nature of the stream, some messages might be consumed by the consumer without being processed on the other end of the stream. If auto commit is used, it might cause message loss after consumer restart. Manual offset storing should be used, see the `store_offset` function on `Consumer`."]]});
